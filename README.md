## Protocol

- Collect larvae using 30 mesh strainer and transfer to a 0.5 tray.
- Use light treatment to move larvae to the edge of the tray so the larvae are separated from the dirt/debris (remnants of food and eggs).
- Collect larvae that congregate at the edge of the tray and run another light treatment.
- After collecting the majority of the larvae in the tray, kill the rest of the larvae left in the tray (which should be a negligible amount compared to the number of larvae hatched).
Before putting larvae into the bottle, make sure that the bottle is clean from larvae or debris. Add lukewarm water to the bottle. Larvae density should be around 80,000 larvae per liter of water.
After connecting the bottle to the system, place a cup where the larvae will come out and start the machine. If larvae are not coming out to the cup after 2 minutes, make sure the bottle is closed tightly.
- During the first run, the dispenser will pour larvae into the cup until it reaches the desired pressure (you can put these larvae back into the second bottle), calculate 20% of the larvae in the cup and insert the amount to the dispenser to the first box.
- Press “initial count”, look at the graph and decide what is the right threshold.
- Insert the correct amount in the first box so it would say the amount you want in the tray and start counting.
- Make sure you are not pressing “initial count” twice because it will start running twice.
- Make sure the bottle doesn’t run out of water and does not reach the bottom line of the bottle.
- Once you reach the end of the larvae, you can add water to the bottle which will dilute the density of the larvae but will allow you to continue counting them without reaching the bottom line of the bottle.
